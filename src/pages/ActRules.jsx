            The primary legislative foundation of the council is The Maharashtra Medical Council Act, 1965, which was enacted to unify and consolidate the laws regulating the registration of medical practitioners in the state. This Act empowers the council to maintain a formal register of practitioners, hear appeals, and exercise disciplinary control over the medical profession. Additionally, the council operates in coordination with the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019.

            The administrative and procedural aspects of the council are governed by the Maharashtra Medical Council Rules, 1967. These rules define the specific protocols for conducting elections for council members, maintaining the register of medical practitioners, and the step-by-step procedure for conducting quasi-judicial inquiries into professional misconduct under Section 22 of the Act. They also prescribe the various forms and fees required for registration and renewal.

          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-[#2E2A21] sm:text-base">
            Professional conduct is regulated by the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, which have been adopted by the MMC. These ethical guidelines mandate that every physician uphold the dignity of the profession, maintain accurate medical records, and prioritize patient care over financial gain. Violation of these ethics, such as advertising services or professional negligence, can lead to disciplinary action, including the temporary or permanent removal of a doctor’s name from the MMC Register.
